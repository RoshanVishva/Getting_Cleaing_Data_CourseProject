----------------------------DATA DICTIONARY - Average of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set --------------------

each row of the data set is average of sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) from an  experiments that have been carried out with
a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities 
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

The first 2 variables denotes the level at which the average of the rest of the measurements were taken, 
i.e averages of the measurement mentioned below are taken at activity and the subject who preformed the activity

The rest of the averages of measurements available in this data set come from averages of  The features  from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals. These time 
domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz.Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals  using 
another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals . and averages from these measurements were derived as follows
Also the averages of magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm . 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

 Averages of Mean value
 Averages Standard deviation
